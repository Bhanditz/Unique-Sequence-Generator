Stimuli generation for auditory memory experiment

Calculates unique 4 digit long number sequences where
each position (1 through 4) contains digits (0 through 9)
the same number of times. Outputs a .csv file for each sequence set.
Calculates sequences from length 10 to a user supplied number 
of digits long (starts running more slowly after 100 digits long, 
currently tested to correctly output 300 digit long sequence).
